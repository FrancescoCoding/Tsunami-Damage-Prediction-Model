# Tsunami Damage Prediction Model ðŸŒŠ
### Probabilistic model that calculates damage (GBP) caused by tsunamis, given their characteristics. 
This project required me to formulate, research and present a mathematical and probabilistic model of attributes relating to a computer simulation with a team of 4 (me included) people.

In this team project, I had to choose, research and define a set of random variables representing a problem feature within a computer-based simulation of a real-life system or phenomenon.

For each random variable, we had to construct an appropriate probabilistic model of the distribution of values that the variable can take and to implement a means in R of randomly generating values for each variable;

Most of the RGN properties created in this model are based on the historical tsunamis dataset you find in this repo [Dataset >](https://github.com/FrancescoCoding/Tsunami-Damage-Prediction-Model/blob/main/tsunami_dataset.csv).

### This team project has enabled me to work on several skills, including:
- Coordinating and leading group sessions to coordinate advancement.
- Formulating a **probabilistic model** illustrated by random samples that accurately match the corresponding model.
- Research and define each attribute of the model rigorously and combined them in a coherent manner.
- Utilizing ggPlot2 for visualizing data
- Utilizing the team management **Agile** framework including:
  - A **Sprint Planning** meeting at the start of each team session
  - One or more **Scrum meetings** throughout the sessions to communicate progress and coordinate activity
  - A **Sprint Review** meeting at the end of the session before each member leaves
