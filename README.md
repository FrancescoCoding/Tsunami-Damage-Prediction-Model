# Tsunami-Modelling-System
This project required me to formulate, research and present a mathematical and probabilistic model of attributes relating to a computer simulation.

In this team project I had to choose, research and define a set of random variables that represent a problem feature within a computer-based simulation of a real-life system or
phenomenon. The simulation can be a direct computer model of the **realword system**, or be intended as a simulation component within a game;

For each random variable, we had to construct an appropriate **probabilistic model** of the distribution of values that the variable can take, and to implement a means in
R of randomly generating values for each variable;

This team project has enabled me to work on several skills.
